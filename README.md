## Description

This module provides guidance for tuning Puppet Enterprise masters given current system size.

The module provides the following sets of values: `monolithic`, `mom` and `compile`. Monolithic values are for Puppet masters which are the only master in an environment. MoM values are tailored the master of masters in a setup that has compile masters. Compile values are for the compile masters in these environments. Unsurprisingly.
